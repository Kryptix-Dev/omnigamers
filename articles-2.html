												<p>Honoring Those Who Sacrificed For Our Freedoms</p>

													This post to remind everyone to keep in mind what Memorial Day actually means.  Many of us enjoy 
													the longer weekend, celebrate it as the "official" start of Summer or a weekend to get some "great 
													deals" with stores offering sales.  Memorial Day is a day of reflection and honor to 
													those in the armed forces who gave the ultimate sacrifice for our freedoms.  As a US Navy veteran, 
													I feel it's important to write this so the meaning of the day isn't lost.  While Memorial Day is a 
													US holiday, I think it's important for everyone in the world to reflect on the struggles of the past 
													and the sacrifices those made to protect their loved ones and their country's beliefs.<br><br>

													Factorio has reached out and grasped onto my quite short attention span and has not seemed to 
													want to let go. I had heard and seen videos of people saying that it is a game that would consume 
													you. I had also heard the same about many games. None of the other games caught my attention. 
													I decided to risk $30 and got it on a whim. It has been more than worth it. It was enough that 
													I bought a second copy for a cousin to join me. Brown W1dow and Red W1dow were now spending hours 
													on one game. But what is Factorio and why did it latch on so tightly?<br><br>

													One of the core values for OmniGamers is to help others. While we are still working on building 
													our foundation to accept donations for charity, I'm happy to announce another way that all of us 
													can contribute to something bigger than ourselves! A big thanks to Optaunix for setting this up! 
													There is an OmniGamers team within the IBM World Community Grid organization! What this organization 
													does is offers a way to add your computer into a world wide computing cluster for processing various 
													algorithms. A few of the projects you can contribute computing power to are "Smash Childhood Cancer", 
													"Help Stop TB", and "Mapping Cancer Markers". Once you install the software (after creating an account 
													of course), you select which projects you want to contribute to, and whenever your computer is idle, this 
													software will handle processing a portion of the work and contribute it's findings (similar to Think F@H 
													or SETI).<br><br>

													We have something different joining us at OmniGamers! Instead of a individual Creator joining our 
													team, we have a team joining our team!  Imbeciles Play Games is joining the Creator team! These 
													three friends have been playing games for years, but somehow, they aren't the best. But, that 
													ensures antics are to ensue their attempts!<br><br>
