													Thank you everyone for joining round 2 of the friendly feud between OmniGamers and VentureKraft!  
													We had a great showing of support for this event, to the point that not everyone could play as 
													we maxed out the teams!  Thank you for showing up!  Of course, the real reason you're here is 
													you want to know who won.  In a clear show of dominance, OmniGamers beat VentureKraft in 8 out 
													of 11 games!<br><br>

													As we come to Good Friday and Easter, OmniGamers is getting ready to make April another 
													great month for gaming and community!  We have something new for April!  Not only a new 
													game, but a multi-part schedule for this game.  Civilization 5 has three parts to it's 
													event due to how long the games take.  We look forward to seeing how this event goes to 
													consider similar longer form games!<br><br>
													
													We are also continuing our event with TagPro against the VentureKraft community!  OmniGamers 
													won the last event, so either join to help us continue our domination over VentureKraft or 
													join to dethrone us!  Either way, we look forward to seeing you there!

													The first ever OmniGamers Rocket League tournament started off with a bang this past weekend!  
													We had seven participants compete in a grueling single eliminations tournament.  Each match 
													was best of three and every team gripped the pitch with all their cars could handle while 
													trying to achieve victory!<br><br>

													Here are the rankings!  In 4th place the team of Kryptix and CalderaTheArcance.  In 3rd 
													place was the team made up by OriontheHunterr and TheRandomist.  2nd place was taken by 
													Garrett.  For those of you that don’t know Garrett is probably the best Rocket League 
													player in OmniGamers.  So he had a bit of a handicap and played with a bot.  And last 
													by not least.  The winner of the first ever OmniGamers Rocket League tournament was…

												<p>So long, and thanks for all the data!</p>

												<p>
													First I want to give a big thanks to everyone who took our survey!  It's the longest one we've asked 
													you to fill out, but it has given us a lot of data to parse through to better understand the 
													community.  Again, thank you!  What I'll do to provide my insight into the results is go through 
													each question and relay the consistent and interesting tidbits.<br><br>
													
													The first question is "Do you think the community is going in the right direction?"  The good news 
													is that everyone said yes, so yay!  I'm glad to hear that everyone agrees things are going well!  
													The second and third questions are about our Discord and the channels we have.  We do have many 
													channels, so I'm always concerned that there may be too many.  23% said there are too many.  
													Unfortunately, those who said yes didn't provide any thoughts on what channels to remove, but I'll 
													make sure not to get too crazy with adding more.  There are four comments about our channels that 
													struck me though.  One asked to have a console gaming channel.  I think we could try this and see 
													how it goes.

													I'm happy to announce our newest creator, RedW1dow!  Red is a relatively new member, but has 
													made a big impact since joining!  Even to the point of earning the title "The Namer" for creating 
													some unique names for our Discord channels!  I'm happy to be bringing Red into the team!  Below 
													is a word from Red as well as a link to his Twitch channel.  Make sure to subscribe!<br><br>

													My name is Red.  I am a nerd.  My video game history is a bit erratic.  I played Super Mario 
													World, MK1, MK2, and a few other games on SNES.  From there I moved on to PSX where I played 
													a lot of THPS and Spyro.  On PS2, I played all the GTA's, COD's, MoH's, and Need for Speed's.  
													From there I made a transition to Xbox 360. That's where I got hooked on multiplayer.  I 
													played a LOT of Halo, MW2, and Oblivion and Skyrim.  I mainly play on Xbox and currently focus 
													on Rainbow Six Siege and Fortnite.  I tend to mainly stream between Friday afternoon Monday 
													afternoons.<br><br>
