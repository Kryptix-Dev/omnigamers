      <description>After a hiatus last month, we're back with some events for the community!  We're working hard on finding a solution to increase turn out for our events.

      <title>A Fallout That Isn't Fallout</title>
      <description>Right off the bat, I’m going to admit it: I love Fallout 4. Despite all its problems, the game was still enjoyable and worth the purchase now that the price has gone down. That being said, I’m no expert on Fallout games or Fallout 4 specifically. I own Fallout 1 and 3...</description>

      <title>Remember What Memorial Day Stands For</title>
      <description>This post to remind everyone to keep in mind what Memorial Day actually means.  Many of us enjoy the longer weekend, celebrate it as the "official" start of Summer or a weekend to get some "great deals" with stores offering sales.  Memorial Day is a day of reflection...</description>

      <title>What the F...actorio?</title>
      <description>Factorio has reached out and grasped onto my quite short attention span and has not seemed to want to let go. I had heard and seen videos of people saying that it is a game that would consume you. I had also heard the same about many games. None of the other games...</description>
