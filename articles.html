													I am glad to announce another creator, but this time, we have another artist joining the group! 
													Please give a warm welcome to TifaDoesArt, now Mear won’t feel like the only artist! And we can 
													force--I mean ask her to help out with graphical projects (lol just kidding)! But seriously, 
													it is always nice to have new members to our creators team!<br><br>

													After a hiatus last month, we're back with some events for the community!  We're working hard on 
													finding a solution to increase turn out for our events.  This is a topic we'll be bringing up at 
													our town hall meetings for a while.  The reason is that it's much more fun of an event when more 
													show up to play!  Please let us know in Discord if there are any games you'd like us to schedule, 
													we're always open to new ideas!<br><br>

												<h2><a href="articles/2018/jun/the-fallout-that-isnt-fallout.html">The Fallout That Isn't Fallout</a></h2>
												<p>A Review of Fallout 4 &amp; Far Harbor</p>

												<p>
													Right off the bat, I’m going to admit it: I love Fallout 4. Despite all its problems, the game was 
													still enjoyable and worth the purchase now that the price has gone down. That being said, I’m no 
													expert on Fallout games or Fallout 4 specifically. I own Fallout 1 and 3, played some of New Vegas, 
													but did not complete any of them. I’m also one of the 10 people who have not played Skyrim, so 
													Fallout really is my only view of the Bethesda style. I only have about 150 hours on Fallout 4 as 
													of this recording, and in that I’ve done 2 playthroughs while currently working on a third. However 
													I’ve really only scratched the surface of what this game offers; my first two goes at the game probably 
													barely explored half of the world combined. This review will also cover the Far Harbor DLC, mainly 
													because it has a lot of interesting parallels to the base game (and also because I haven’t completed 
													Nuka-World and don’t care as much about the other DLC).<br><br>

													Heyo Guys! Well, here's another one, ALREADY?!? Yep! It's time for the monthly Town hall
													meeting and, though not much happened in May, it went pretty fast! We hope y'all had a great
													time, and now have a great summer! We have a lot of stuff to do now!<br><br>
													
													Community Servers: We are working subsequently on Unturned and Minecraft Severs. It might
													be helpful to have Connection Info on the website and we have added a Community Servers
													channel in the bulletin board of discord.<br><br>
