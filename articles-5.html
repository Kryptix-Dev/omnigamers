													First, I want to thank everyone who attended out meeting today!  This was a spontaneous idea 
													among the Coordinators and I'm happy to see those who attended to provide input on new ideas 
													and for us to share other ideas that are in development!  Below are the notes from today's 
													meeting!<br><br>
													
													The winter survey is live!  These quarterly surveys provide a lot of great data for the 
													Coordinators to help us plan future events and we can gauge what the community wants in 
													terms of features!  We have received 15 responses so far.  If you haven't taken the survey, 
													please do so <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/X8UZdzyzsryaCO5h2">here</a>.

													We are happy to announce a new member to the Creator team, The Randomist!  Random has been 
													with the group for a while, but only recently started getting into streaming on Twitch!  
													Below is a message from Randomist as well as a link to their Twitch channel!<br><br>
													
													Hi, I've been gaming since I was a kid playing Theme Hospital on Win 95. These days you'll 
													usually find me playing strategy or RPG games if I'm not working through a backlog of Steam 
													games.<br><br>

													Continuing from our commitment from the beginning of the year, we are scheduling events for 
													the next month at the end of the current month to make it easier for everyone to work with 
													their schedule!  It has made a difference in attendance and enjoyment when we have longer events 
													than a one time event over a few hours!<br><br>
													
													You can use the links below to see the details for each scheduled game.  Take note that the 
													Rocket League tournament has a signup cutoff to gauge how many will show up so we can determine 
													if the tournament will be singles or doubles.<br>

												<h2><a href="articles/2018/feb/player-of-the-week-feb-24.html">Shoc is Our Player of the Week!</a></h2>
												<p>Bringing in that Precious Oil in World of Warships!</p>
												<ul class="meta">

												<p>
													This week's Player of the Week has been selected due to Shoc bringing in a LOT of oil for
													our clan!  To date, Shoc has brought in 330 barrels since we created the clan on Feb 10!  
													That is some dedication!  Torres2131 is second at 320 and then myself at third with 300.  
													For those unfamiliar with World of Warships, oil is obtained through opening up free daily 
													crates and is used by the clan officers to research facilities to offer bonuses to the clan 
													members.  With a big push by everyone this last week in the clan, we were able to open the 
													U.S. Research Center to offer all clan members with a U.S. ship an XP boost!<br><br>
													
													For those who are in the clan, please continuing playing and earning us oil so we can unlock
													more bonuses for everyone!  Thank you for your hard work this week Shoc!

												<h2><a href="articles/2018/feb/special-tagpro-event-feb-24.html">Special TagPro Event on Feb 24!</a></h2>
												<p>OmniGamers vs. VentureKraft TagPro Event!</p>
												<ul class="meta">

												<p>
													The gauntlet has been thrown!  In our first joint event, OmniGamers will be going head-to-head 
													against VentureKraft in a special TagPro event!  To get more information about the event, such 
													as the time it is for you in your timezone, the invite link (which will also be posted in 
													Discord), and a link to TagPro, please check our event calendar <a href="https://teamup.com/event/show/id/jCGjtqjj7ySQ6pmZgcFyKqiSkTyUAf">here</a>.<br><br>
													
													For those unfamiliar, VentureKraft is the name of the Minecraft server community that took over 
													after I stepped down as owner of OmniGamers, which is the inspiration for the OmniGamers name!  
													As is usual for our events, there will be an invite link provided about an hour before the event 
													starts.
