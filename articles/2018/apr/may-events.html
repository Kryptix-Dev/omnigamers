													Wow, we're already 1/3 of the way through the year!  'Tis the time for the changing of the seasons!  
													Those of us in the northern hemisphere are enjoy spring, or at least the final stretches of winter.  
													Those in the southern hemisphere are bundling up for fall and into winter.  To enjoy these changes, 
													let's play some games together!<br><br>
													
													First, I want to recognize that April has been a quite month for us on this website.  It seems many 
													of us Coordinators have had a busy month and we haven't been on the ball as well as we should have 
													been.  I hope that with May, we'll change that and kick things back into gear!  Part of that is we 
													didn't have a town hall meeting in April.  We do have one again for May, so we hope you'll join us 
													as we discuss a few topics about the community!<br><br>
													
													Click <a href="https://teamup.com/event/show/id/Ht4mLEHrT9Ve8sACs8JWdMtT3tMUnr">here</a> for more 
													info and when the meeting will be for you!<br><br>
													
													Now onto the events!  In a first for us, we're trying an organized discussion on a specific topic.  
													This event was voted on by all of you for us to have!  These sessions will be recorded and shared 
													for all of you to enjoy later or to listen to if you can't attend.  These discussions will be lead 
													by one or a few members of the community and allowing for anyone to jump in with thoughts or 
													questions!  Our first such discussion will be lead by me, Kryptix, and about Space Travel!<br><br>
													
													More info <a href="https://teamup.com/event/show/id/jFEJQ1DaVcBrttUjr7A6cprmUDG8jz">here</a> on this discussion!<br><br>
													
													Now it's time for games!  Besides Rocket League, our events for May are all about strategy!  We 
													also have a new game added to our lineup, Warframe!  Make sure to join us for that, and, if there 
													is enough interest, we can host our own clan for you to join!  That has been working out well for 
													us in World of Warships, and we're looking forward to continuing this in other games!<br><br>
													
													<a href="https://teamup.com/event/show/id/GRA2zsXU54AXTQg5ChgWzbFCxNZTky">Rocket League Week</a> -
													<a href="https://teamup.com/event/show/id/9C8Z2mZu2ndwTBZZC1VhP4Kr9cjSaT">Command &amp; Conquer</a> -

													Lastly, <a href="https://teamup.com/event/show/id/w5VGLLUmjL7CyqVcEbvLwS5xNA4zBG">OK vs VK 4 in TF2</a><br><br>
													
													Sign-ups are available for all the events, so make sure to enter your in-game name or nick name (
													we don't want your real name or email address) to let us know you'll be there!
