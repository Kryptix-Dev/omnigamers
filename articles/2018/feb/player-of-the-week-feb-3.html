													We had a rip, roaring, blasting good time at the Rocket League game night!  While we all had 
													fun, there was one player that stood out from the crowd.  With the ability to keep his team's 
													goal closed off from the enemy, and kick some bullets into the other team's goal, 
													CalderaTheArcane is given the title PLAYER OF THE WEEK!<br><br>
													Everyone showed a lot of skill during the game night and many made drastic improvements in the 
													game play in just over the the hour that we played together.  Everyone was great at being team 
													players and showed off their stuff!<br><br>
													This week I determined the player of the week by keeping track of the MVPs on both teams in each 
													game.  Caldera won by 2 MVP titles over his next closet player which was a two way tie between 
													Clumby and X3racer.<br><br>
													We will have lots more Rocket League events to come during our game week in the next few days so 
													make sure to hop online and check the fun!<br><br>
													Congrats, CalderatheArcane!!
