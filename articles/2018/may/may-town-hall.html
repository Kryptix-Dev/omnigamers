													It’s that time again! Though we missed that of last month, today marks the second “Town Hall Meeting”. 
													Many exciting ideas came up today and I made sure to take the “minutes” for those who couldn’t attend. 
													Much of what came up had to do with Creators, the idea of creating a newsletter, and the idea of 
													running OG game servers. We have gotten many ideas from the questions raised, and though some have been 
													put on the back burner, we plan to get to work on others ASAP!! Below you can find the notes that I 
													was able to take-and also expect to see some polls about these ideas within the discord channel.<br><br>

													Computer Dave said: "'How to increase participation in the gaming events' I know it might be limited by 
													ownership of a particular game, but only having 7 people in the Rocket League tourney seems low to me"<br>
													Create More Hype, Giveaways of games, find root, boost playing of more popular games such as Rocket 
													League and World of Warships, find more games that are popular within people in community, and get 
													creators involved.<br><br>

													Mear said: "What about removing inactive members as a topic?"<br>
													There’s not much point to remove inactive players, as they don’t really harm us and they often have to 
													deal with real life. However, Coordinators should review this, because it again has to do with the 
													activity problem.<br><br>

													Computer Dave said: "with a 3D printer in the mix, maybe we could design some small trophy-like trinkets?"<br>
													Shipping costs and relying on people who have the 3D printers would down-put the awesomeness of this idea 
													(later tied in to possibly getting a Patreon, see next topic).<br><br>

													(like mentioned before) Wolfalamew (me) said: "Maybe OG could create a Patreon page for giveouts and 
													supplies for stuff like the 3D printer mentioned before?" And OriontheHunterr backed it with the 
													following: "[That would be good,] But I think what we would want to fund first is a server for people 
													to play on.  A permanent Factorio server or something like that.  Give people somewhere to just go 
													and chat while playing a game."<br>
													That might be a good idea, but we would want to see what perks people would want. As well 
													TwelvePointFive has offered game servers to the community, but if we can’t find uses for them then 
													he will sell them or give them away to others who have called second dibs, however I wont talk too much 
													of that now because this is also a later topic.<br><br>

													Red W1dow said: "How [a]bout created more conversation based content?"<br>
													And Mear backed it with the following: "That would be interesting... we could see about some cross play 
													stuff and then streaming together...That is a reason I streaming the Rocket League Tournament.  Gets 
													people to see a bunch of people playing together and maybe making them want to join the next one." And 
													Red W1dow replied with: "Current Cross play games are Fortnite, Rocket League, and I think Sea of 
													Thieves" (Creator Topic)<br>
													Stream nights where people stream while other members of OG also play? In it might be a good idea to 
													add in Sea of Thieves to OG as it seems relatively popular within the community. Also, it might interest 
													us to focus somewhat on games with “guilds” and have certain players run them.<br><br>

													Red W1dow said: "If doing tag-team streams, we can work on having some sort of guided conversations to 
													get people interested in listening" (Creator Topic)<br>
													That might help grow the communities of the creators. This topic is kind of covered by what was said 
													in the last topic.<br><br>

													Red W1dow said: "what about refining our niche to a few categories? Such as having Kryptix focus on 
													racing games ([be]cause it seems that you do a bit of that and it's just an example) or having a 
													couple people always doing the Battle Royale streams" and Mear disagreed with the following: 
													"@(ping)RedW1dow I don't think that's a good idea, because then you limit the creators to only 
													play a specific genre of games. And I personally like a variety of game genres" and Wolfalamew 
													(me) backed Mear’s comment with: "That's a valid point, it may hurt their channels..." And Red 
													W1dow countered with: "I don't want to limit them, but like if we are doing Fortnite streaming, 
													we can have a set of people that are more likely to participate. That way viewers can get used 
													to reoccurring Creators" (Creator Topic)<br>
													It is easy for creators to build a fanbase with certain genres, however people will want to play 
													certain games and they can’t really be limited. It’s not really the most annoying thing when people 
													are doing different genres, maybe build a fanbase but don’t always stay oriented to one specific 
													genre. However, the idea for limitations is nearly unanimously a bad decision.<br><br>

													Red W1dow said: "Let's also talk about the Newsletter/Email idea...how bout OG goals?" And Computer 
													Dave backed it with the following: "what's our total member count right now? Maybe a Member Goal?"<br>
													Current member count is 183 also goals would probably motivate people to get into events and would 
													help people get drive and want to do stuff within the community. In the newsletter we have few people 
													who are interested in writing, mostly Coordinators but we probably need to focus on getting the 
													Newsletter up, we plan content to be focused on events within the communities, games, and technology. 
													We will likely have this e-mailed to people who subscribe via the website (for instance through Mail 
													Chimp) and maybe have people create the pages and just pick pages to put into that week or month’s 
													newsletter, we might have pages on the website based on game news, but we need people to write it up. 
													To be honest the newsletter is just a proactive way of getting OG news to members. We might do reviews 
													on games within the site or newsletter as well. Also, there may be the point to focus stuff within the 
													newsletter possibly based on the OG YouTube channel.<br><br>

													Mear said: "What about letting the members decide more on what and when the Game Nights will be?" And 
													Red W1dow backed it with the following: "@(ping)Mear [Lvl. 3] how [a]bout a monthly poll to see what 
													games will be chosen for the following month?"<br>
													We have done polls before, but not many answer, if more answered this would be helpful and again might 
													help with activity and consistently. Also, some might not have the popular games others want to play. 
													Again, if more would reply to polls this would be a great idea, so it really comes down to the fact 
													that we need to foster activity.<br><br>

													Computer Dave said: "what about setting up a sort of mentoring vid series/stream meetup for things like 
													learning programming or game design?" And Mear reaplied with; "@ComputerDave I guess that could be a 
													series for the OGC YT" and OriontheHunterr added: "That would probably be best on another channel. 
													Channels should stay focused.  Mear's art ones are cool and break from gaming but if we want to do 
													the teaching things seriously then it should be a different channel.  Unless it [is] teaching some people 
													how to play a game that is."(Tech Support Topic)<br>
													There are many here who are here because of IT and one of options for creator within the Creator application 
													happens to be Tech Creations. There is a lot on OG about games, but it isn’t all games, we have stuff to 
													do with Philosophy, Tech, Food, and games. Not to say games aren’t a large part of that but it’s not the 
													whole. It would be very interesting to learn from these. This topic is still up for discussion though 
													because it might require the time to focus specifically on one area of expertise and getting people 
													who wants to do those videos.<br><br> 

													Red W1dow said: "Another idea: Graphic Artist volunteers. To help create similar graphics for Twitch or 
													YT" (Creator Topic)<br>
													Currently, one of the creators, Mear, is doing a lot of stuff like this. However, it does require putting 
													a burden on those people and takes up their time. If people would be interested in volunteering, we may 
													encourage the practice-as long as it isn’t to burdening on them, we won’t force them. This might also mean 
													that they would need the tools, which may cost money.<br><br>

													Mear Said: "As for topics:<br>
													-serie(s) Ideas and plans for OG Channel<br>
													- I guess tell everyone what he's/she's planning for their channel/twitch and how the other could help"<br>
													As said earlier, collabs are helpful for getting views and a shared following. Most of our ideas the OG 
													channel goes back to what we have said earlier, on the latter part of that it would likely be beneficial 
													to have people say what they are going for and how others can help.<br><br>

													TwelvePointFive said: “We currently have dedicated server space available for permanent gameservers and 
													events. (If we don’t decide a use for it, it may no longer be an option in the future.) What are some 
													games people would like to see OG servers for?”<br>
													This was brought up earlier, and as we are planning TF2 seems to be a good idea, as well as Minecraft. 
													If other suggestions come up we are free to hear them and partake in others’ ideas; which is the whole 
													reason of the survey and feedback channels.<br><br>

													Wolfalamew (me) said: "There is a high likelihood that people throughout the community might benefit from 
													game/channel specific bots, such as Minecord for Minecraft (avatars, statuses, etc.)"<br>
													This is helpful, but we don’t want to over-saturate the discord with bots, as we do have quite a few. 
													There are uses but this hasn’t become a big issue to be honest. Some of the bots we have already, we do 
													pay for which is another issue, some of those bots aren’t used very often. For now this idea is off to 
													the back-burner, but it does show some interest and we may even get a custom bot from some people that 
													code bots within OG.<br><br>

													These are all the topics for now, thanks to those who contributed; it is much appreciated. As for now, 
													hope to see y’all later!! Bye!
