												<h2>March Town Hall Meeting Minutes</h2>

													First, I want to thank everyone who attended out meeting today!  This was a spontaneous idea 
													among the Coordinators and I'm happy to see those who attended to provide input on new ideas 
													and for us to share other ideas that are in development!  Below are the notes from today's 
													meeting!<br><br>
													
													The winter survey is live!  These quarterly surveys provide a lot of great data for the 
													Coordinators to help us plan future events and we can gauge what the community wants in 
													terms of features!  We have received 15 responses so far.  If you haven't taken the survey, 
													please do so <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/X8UZdzyzsryaCO5h2">here</a>.<br><br>
													
													We have add a new feature for our Creators, thanks to an idea by Valkyriel!  We will now 
													have a featured Creator, which will change every two weeks!  This came about as we felt 
													that Creators may not get a lot of attention, even though there are many of us active in 
													Discord.  For featured Creators, we ask everyone either watch their streams or videos as 
													they are posted.  Even if they are in the background.  This will help the featured Creator 
													get more views and help them grow their channels!  Our first featured Creator is ComputerDave!  
													You can follow Dave at the links below.<br>
													Twitch: <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/comput3rdave">twitch.tv/comput3rdave</a><br>
													YouTube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/computerdave06">youtube.com/user/computerdave06</a><br><br>
													
													Wolfalamew suggested an idea for having a food contest due to the high interest in our 
													feed-the-foodies channel in Discord!  Quite a few (mostly garathnor) share the dishes 
													they make and make everyone hungry!  Many of us in the meeting discussed how it could be 
													run, how the winner will be selected and what the prize would be.  Suggestions are welcome!<br><br>
													
													I announced that I feel the community is close to being at the point where it would make 
													sense to start accepting donations.  It's been a goal of mine to eventually offers a 
													way to receive donations for different organizations, so our hobby can do some good in 
													the world, similar to Games Done Quick and Extra Life.  The reason we haven't yet is I don't 
													want the community to be in a point where there is pressure on just a few to donate, so 
													we're working on growing the community more.  Donations would also go to any server hosting 
													costs for the games!  Keep an eye out for when we open this!<br><br>
													
													Moving forward, we're going to try to keep track of different metics for all our events.  
													We hope that by doing so, we can better gauge how "successful" an event is and if we 
													should hold a similar one or figuring how to change it to make it better.  We'll let you 
													know how this project goes in future meetings!<br><br>
													
													One thing that we have changed is we are focusing more on week long events and having a 
													"bonus" event at a specific time.  This change was thanks to your feedback, and one we 
													as Coordinators agree with.  Some were having a tough time making the events when it was 
													set at a specific time, and it also puts a bit more pressure on the Coordinators to be 
													there as well.  Also with a week long event, it gives that game more exposure so maybe 
													more will join in on the fun!<br><br>
													
													With discussion Creators, a question was asked (I'm sorry, I forgot to record who said
													this.  Let me know and I'll update this post!) about having a graphic artist style rank 
													for those who would be willing to create graphics for the community.  I mentioned this 
													is a great idea, but we'd need to have a base of the community to start it with.  If 
													anyone is interested in supporting the community this way, please let me know!<br><br>
													
													Another idea that came up was to have more custom commands in Discord (again I forgot 
													to record the name of who mentioned this).  While we have the ?calendar command, there 
													are no other commands.  One that was suggested is for this website.  I'm more than 
													happy to add in custom commands, I just haven't though of any good ones.  If you 
													have ideas, please let me know!<br><br>
													
													Another member (I need to make sure to record names next time, I think it was MrShawn) 
													mentioned that some channels have too many items pinned.  This is usually due to 
													duplicate pins, or redundant pins.  For anyone who sees pins that could be removed, 
													please let any of the Coordinators know so we can clean them up!  We don't always 
													think about checking them.<br><br>
													
													Another member (oye, sorry) suggested having a Discord bot that could announce when 
													a new video is available on YouTube.  While our currents bots don't offer that, if 
													anyone knows of one, please let me know!<br><br>
													
													Stockley_ (I believe) suggested that a new type of article that could be on the 
													website is mentions and announcements for member projects or other news.  I think 
													this is a great idea!  If you have something you want to share, please write up 
													a paragraph or two and a have an image (if you can) of a way to represent that 
													and I'll get it added for you!<br><br>
													
													We lastly ended the meeting thanking everyone who joined us for the meeting!  
													Again, this is an idea that the Coordinators just came up with, so we hope that 
													everyone who attended got something out of it, and it allows us another outlet to 
													be more open with what's going on within the community!  Please let us know your 
													thoughts on the meeting as well as the frequency.  Should we have these every 
													month?  Every other month?  Once a quarter?  Let us know!
