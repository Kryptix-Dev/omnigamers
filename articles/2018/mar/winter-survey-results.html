													First I want to give a big thanks to everyone who took our survey!  It's the longest one we've asked 
													you to fill out, but it has given us a lot of data to parse through to better understand the 
													community.  Again, thank you!  What I'll do to provide my insight into the results is go through 
													each question and relay the consistent and interesting tidbits.<br><br>
													
													The first question is "Do you think the community is going in the right direction?"  The good news 
													is that everyone said yes, so yay!  I'm glad to hear that everyone agrees things are going well!  
													The second and third questions are about our Discord and the channels we have.  We do have many 
													channels, so I'm always concerned that there may be too many.  23% said there are too many.  
													Unfortunately, those who said yes didn't provide any thoughts on what channels to remove, but I'll 
													make sure not to get too crazy with adding more.  There are four comments about our channels that 
													struck me though.  One asked to have a console gaming channel.  I think we could try this and see 
													how it goes.  To expand on that, another comment suggests adding a specific channel for games that 
													have interest.  We've been doing that, so there isn't a problem with doing so.  I think one of the 
													best comments for this is doing more to combine channels.  An example is we have a Civilization &amp; 
													Stellaris channel, which were merged and named "civ-ellaris".  I think this is a great idea to help 
													keep the number of channels from getting crazy.  Thanks for this suggestion!  I've done this with one 
													channel already, which was Fortnite, but now renamed to Battle Royale since more games are offering 
													this game mode.  Suggestions are appreciated on channels to combine!<br><br>
													
													The next few questions are regarding our game nights and events.  Unfortunately, not everyone has 
													been able to attend a game night, usually because they aren't available at specific times.  The 
													good news with that is we're holding more week long events than specific time-frames, which several 
													of you wrote that you appreciated us doing.  We're happy this change is helping!  A few of you also 
													mentioned that having a broader range of games, especially in the free-to-play category, would be 
													ideal.  These surveys help us determine what games to schedule (to be mentioned below), or just 
													letting us know in Discord so we make sure we're trying new games!<br><br>
													
													In terms of times for best availability, weekends and Friday nights are the most consistent 
													mentioned.  One new trend I noticed this time is having events scheduled weekend nights.  This I'll 
													make sure to keep in mind for the future.  There are also more who mentioned being in European time 
													zones, which I'm sure Foshiee is more than happy to work with you on.<br><br>
													
													The next questions are regarding us Coordinators.  The good news is that everyone thinks we're doing 
													a great job!  It's appreciated to hear that, which gives us motivation to work harder and do the most 
													that we can for everyone!  One comment mentioned they appreciated us having several events scheduled 
													ahead of time, such as how we announce the next month's events at the end of the current month.  I was 
													late for March, but we do strive to get that schedule out before the month starts.  Another comment 
													was how they enjoyed the cross-community event in TagPro with VentureKraft.  We do have another 
													scheduled for March, and I hope we can do this more often!  If you are part of another gaming 
													community and would like to schedule a similar event, please let us Coordinators know!<br><br>
													
													Now we have questions about the games all of you are playing, as well as games to check out.  This is 
													one of the most important questions for us, so we know if there are games we're not thinking about and 
													to scheduled an event around!  For this survey, we have a broader range of games that we'll make sure 
													check out for options!  Below are the list of games most mentioned, ranked from most to least.<br><br>
													
													Minecraft, Rocket League, Stellaris, World of Warships, Factorio<br><br>
													
													For those who haven't joined, we have ranks in our Discord for each of these games to help with 
													coordinating games and sharing news for those games.  If you haven't joined those, please do so by 
													typing ?ranks to see a list, and ?rank [game] to join that specific game.<br><br>
													
													Out of everyone who took the survey, only one said they didn't like the idea of us having a clan, 
													guild, etc. within various games.  We're glad that the majority are enjoying these, as it helps us 
													coordinate games and matches much easier in those games, as well as gives us another outlet for 
													advertising the community and finding new members to join!<br><br>
													
													In regards to our Creators, two mentioned they didn't like what we have setup for them.  Only one 
													of those left a comment for improvement, which we actually implemented!  This suggestion was to have 
													a featured Creator that is focused on for a period of time to help improve their views and stats.  
													We hope this will help our Creators build up their channels more, and we ask everyone in the community 
													to keep an eye on when we announce a new featured Creator to help out!  As for game suggestions for 
													our Creators, the consistent one is PUBG.  A few of them play, but maybe more will consider this 
													for their channel.<br><br>
													
													Those are the results of our survey, which has given us a lot of helpful info to work with.  We 
													like to have a survey once a quarter to see what changes over time, and to encourage more in the 
													community to provide feedback.  Please keep an eye out for when we post our next survey!
